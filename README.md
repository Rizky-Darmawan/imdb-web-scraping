# IMDB Web Scraping Project

Web scraping of www.imdb.com to collect action movies data from the website. The data was collected via every individual movie pages by generating
every links from the action movie filter. The codes that I used is in the Web Scraping Code folder under Main Code.py python file. The other python file
was used only for testing and troubleshooting.

The scraped data includes :
1. Movie titles
2. Released dates
3. MPAA ratings / Age rating
4. Movie runtime
5. Critics review score (Metascore)
6. User review score
7. Directors
8. Writers
9. Studios
10. Budget
11. US gross income
12. Worldwide gross income
13. Movie aspect ratio

The scraped data then cleaned and standarized using jupyter nootebook. You can check the notebook to see my tought process when cleaning
the dataset. You can see before and after results by checking the action_movies.csv and action_movies_cleaned.csv file.
